# Task-5-Data-Science---Text-Classification-on-consumer-complaint-dataset

1. Introduction
   
    Consumer complaints contain valuable insights that can be used to categorize issues into predefined categories for better customer support and trend analysis. In     his project, we classify consumer complaints into four categories:

         1.Credit Reporting, Credit Repair, or Other Personal Consumer Reports
         2.Debt Collection
         3.Consumer Loan
         4.Mortgage
   
    We employ various machine learning and deep learning models to analyze, process, and classify textual data. This document outlines the key steps in the data 
    processing pipeline and evaluates different models for classification performance.
