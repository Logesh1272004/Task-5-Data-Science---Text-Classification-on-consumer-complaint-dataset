# Task-5-Data-Science---Text-Classification-on-consumer-complaint-dataset

1. Introduction
Consumer complaints contain valuable insights that can be used to categorize issues into predefined categories for better customer support and trend analysis. In this project, we classify consumer complaints into four categories:

Credit Reporting, Credit Repair, or Other Personal Consumer Reports
Debt Collection
Consumer Loan
Mortgage
We employ various machine learning and deep learning models to analyze, process, and classify textual data. This document outlines the key steps in the data processing pipeline and evaluates different models for classification performance.
